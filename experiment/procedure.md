## Task-1: Exploring Parameter Effects on Wavefunctions
=======
⭐ When you enter the simulation section, a guided tour will appear. It is strongly recommended that you take the tour, as it provides step-by-step instructions to help you understand the experiment thoroughly. The tour also introduces you to the various controls, features, and interface elements, making it easier for you to navigate and explore the experiment effectively.

### Task-1: Quantum Wavefunction Visualization and Potential Type Identification
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

- Use the controls panel to adjust parameters such as potential type, energy, and other quantum properties.
- As you change these parameters, observe how the wavefunction plots update in real time.
- The simulation allows you to switch between different potentials (e.g., infinite well, harmonic oscillator) and see their effect on the wavefunction.
- **Your task:** Experiment with different parameter values and describe how the wavefunction shape and properties change.


## Task-2: Challenges and Quizzes

- Navigate to the Challenge tab to attempt interactive quizzes, fill-in-the-blank, and matching exercises based on your observations.
- Label diagrams, answer multiple-choice questions, and complete matching tasks to reinforce your understanding.
- Immediate feedback is provided for each attempt.
- **Your task:** Complete the challenges to test your understanding of quantum wavefunctions and their properties.
