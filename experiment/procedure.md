### Task-1: Quantum Wavefunction Visualization and Potential Type Identification

In the first task, the user is presented with quantum wavefunction visualizations showing different potential configurations. The simulation displays:
- Two wavefunction plots with different potential shapes labeled "infinite well" and "harmonic oscillator"
- Energy eigenstate solutions showing distinct probability density distributions
- Quantum number dependencies with different n-values for each potential type
- Interactive 3D visualization of wavefunction evolution and probability clouds

The user must identify and label each wavefunction with their respective potential type and explain how boundary conditions affect the quantum states and energy levels.

### Task-2: Interactive Parameter Effects on Quantum States

In the second task, there are interactive controls showing how quantum parameters affect wavefunction properties where users can observe:
- **Energy Level Adjustment**: Modify quantum energy from 0.1-5.0 eV to see eigenstate changes
- **Potential Width Control**: Vary potential well width to study confinement effects
- **Potential Depth Variation**: Adjust potential barrier height to observe bound state formation
- **Quantum Number Selection**: Change principal quantum numbers to explore different eigenstates

Real-time wavefunction updates allow users to understand the relationship between potential parameters, boundary conditions, and resulting quantum mechanical solutions.

### Task-3: Wavefunction Properties and Measurement Analysis

In the third task, users explore quantum measurement concepts through:
- **Probability Density Visualization**: Toggle between wavefunction amplitude and probability density views
- **Position Uncertainty**: Measure position spreads and uncertainty principle demonstrations
- **Momentum Distribution**: Analyze momentum space representations and Fourier transforms
- **Energy Eigenvalue Calculation**: Study energy quantization and level spacing

Interactive draggers allow real-time parameter adjustment with immediate feedback on quantum mechanical properties and measurement outcomes.

### Task-4: Quantum Tunneling and Barrier Penetration

In the fourth task, the simulation demonstrates quantum tunneling phenomena with:
- **Barrier Transmission**: Visualize wavefunction penetration through potential barriers
- **Tunneling Probability**: Calculate transmission coefficients for different barrier configurations
- **Wave Packet Dynamics**: Observe time evolution of quantum wave packets approaching barriers
- **Reflection Coefficients**: Study partial reflection and transmission at potential discontinuities

Users can adjust barrier parameters and observe how quantum particles exhibit wave-like behavior in classically forbidden regions.
