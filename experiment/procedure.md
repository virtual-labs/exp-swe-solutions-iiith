# Procedure for Using the Quantum Wavefunction Virtual Lab Simulation

## Task-1: Exploring Parameter Effects on Wavefunctions

- Use the controls panel to adjust parameters such as potential type, energy, and other quantum properties.
- As you change these parameters, observe how the wavefunction plots update in real time.
- The simulation allows you to switch between different potentials (e.g., infinite well, harmonic oscillator) and see their effect on the wavefunction.
- **Your task:** Experiment with different parameter values and describe how the wavefunction shape and properties change.


## Task-2: Challenges and Quizzes

- Navigate to the Challenge tab to attempt interactive quizzes, fill-in-the-blank, and matching exercises based on your observations.
- Label diagrams, answer multiple-choice questions, and complete matching tasks to reinforce your understanding.
- Immediate feedback is provided for each attempt.
- **Your task:** Complete the challenges to test your understanding of quantum wavefunctions and their properties.
