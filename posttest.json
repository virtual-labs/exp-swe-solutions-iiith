            "question": "1. Explain the difference between an infinite potential well and a finite potential well.",
            "answers": {
                "a": "An infinite potential well has infinite energy levels, while a finite potential well has finite energy levels.",
                "b": "An infinite potential well has infinitely high walls, while a finite potential well has walls with finite height.",
                "c": "An infinite potential well has a continuous spectrum of energy, while a finite potential well has a discrete spectrum.",
                "d": "An infinite potential well has zero probability of finding a particle outside the well, while a finite potential well has non-zero probability."
            },
            "explanations": {
                "a": "This is incorrect because both infinite and finite potential wells have discrete energy levels. The key difference lies in the height of the potential walls, not the number of energy levels.",
                "b": "This is correct. An infinite potential well has walls with infinite height, meaning the particle cannot escape. A finite potential well has walls with finite height, allowing for the possibility of the particle tunneling outside the well.",
                "c": "This is incorrect. Both infinite and finite potential wells have discrete energy levels. The difference is in the height of the potential walls, not the nature of the energy spectrum.",
                "d": "This is partially correct but not the best answer. While it is true that a particle in an infinite potential well cannot be found outside the well, the primary difference lies in the height of the potential walls."
